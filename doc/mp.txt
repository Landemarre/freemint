Memory Protection
=================

Memory protection works on a per-process basis.  Unless it uses the special
mode bits in Mxalloc(), a process' entire text+data+bss and any memory it
allocates will be of the same type.  There are four types of memory:

	1. Private.  Only the process itself (and the OS) can use the memory.

	2. Global.  This memory is totally unprotected.

	3. Super.  This memory can be accessed by anybody from Super mode.

	4. Private/readable.  Anybody can read, nobody else can write.

By default, all processes load into private memory.  If a program
terminates and remains resident with the Ptermres() system call, then
its private memory will be converted to Super memory; that's because
TSRs won't work in private memory. Some TSRs may in fact need to be
set to load into global memory (if they provide services for user
mode programs).  There are other programs which need to grant wider access
to their memory space: for example, the Gulam CLI is
one, because Gulam's children can call Gulam through a pointer found in the
system variable space.  But Gulam is a bad choice of shell anyway, because
you can't run more than one of them.  Current versions of STeno also must
grant wider access, because it passes data to STalker using shared memory;
private/readable is adequate for that.

Programs that load before MiNT does (i.e. in the AUTO folder) will find
themselves in global memory.  This is the easiest way to be sure that
your TSRs will go on working: RAMdisks, FOLDR100, CACHE080, etc. all
work when loaded that way.

Notice that a process can grant wider access to its own address space, but
it can't change the access permissions of any other process' space. If you
set the PRGFLAGS of some process so it loads into global memory, that
doesn't mean it can access anybody else's memory, it just means that
anybody can access ITS memory.

Memory Requirements
===================

To make memory protection work, additional memory to store the protection
tables is required. The exact amount is:

- for 030, for every process:
    128 bytes for every 256MB of memory available (ST- or TT-RAM)
  + 384 bytes
  + 128 bytes for every 16MB of TT-RAM
  + 1024 bytes for every MB of memory (ST- or TT-RAM)

  Additionaly, for a table that is shared between all processes:
      2K
    + 128 bytes for every MB of TT-RAM
  
  For example, with 16MB ST-RAM + 16MB TT-RAM, that will make
  - ~18K per process
  - 4K globally

  for 16MB ST-RAM + 256MB TT-RAM, that will make
  - ~243 KB per process
  - 34K globally

  That is, running 100 processes at the same time will eat up
  ~10% of your TT-RAM just for these tables! You have been warned.
